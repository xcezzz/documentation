Desktop Synchronization
========================

For synchronizing files with your desktop computer, we recommend using the
|cloudName| Client for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

The |cloudName| Desktop Client enables you to connect to your private |cloudName| Server. 
You can create folders in your home directory, and keep the contents of those 
folders synced with your |cloudName| server. Simply copy a file into the directory 
and the |cloudName| desktop client does the rest. Make a change to the files on one 
computer, it will flow across the others using these desktop sync clients. Always 
have your latest files with you wherever you are. 

Furthermore, It is possible to synchronize your |cloudName| calendar and address book
with a variety of different operating systems and devices. It is also possible to
mount your |cloudName| storage via WebDAV, which is also documented in the next chapters.
