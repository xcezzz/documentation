Synchronizing with KDE SC
=========================

From KDE SC 4.8 and forward setting up |cloudName| is very easy. From System
Settings Personal Information/Akonadi Resources Configuration select DAV
Groupware resource.


.. image:: ../images/kdes2.png

Enter your |cloudName| username and password and click "Next".


.. image:: ../images/kdes3.png

Select own Cloud in the drop down list and click "Next".

.. image:: ../images/kdes4.png

Enter the host name (|cloudUrl|) and installation path. 


.. image:: ../images/kdes5.png

Test the connection. If everything went well you should see a message
like the one below.


.. image:: ../images/kdes6.png

Click "Finish" and you will be able to change the display name and
refresh interval.

Now you should see the Akonadi resource doing the first
synchronization.

You can find the Contacts and Calendars in Kontact (or
KOrganizer/KAddressbook if you run the programs separately.)
